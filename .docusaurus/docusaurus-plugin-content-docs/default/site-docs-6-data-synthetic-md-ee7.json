  "description": "Synthetic data is data that might have been generated by financial markets but was not. Synthetic price and return data address the financial small data problem and have numerous uses, including testing new investment strategies and feeding data-hungry ML models. They also help us to detect behavior and outlier discrepancies between real and mimicked markets. For example, if our model performs well on a subset of real-world data, we can check it against synthetic data to find out whether we introduced the look-ahead bias or any other Achilles' heel to our model without knowing it.",
