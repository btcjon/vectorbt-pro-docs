  "description": "Portfolio optimization is all about creating a portfolio of assets such that our investment has the maximum return and minimum risk. A portfolio in this regard is the asset distribution of an investor - a weight vector, which can be well optimized for risk appetite, expected rate of return, cost minimization, and other target metrics. Moreover, such optimization can be performed on a regular basis to account for any recent changes in the market behavior.",
