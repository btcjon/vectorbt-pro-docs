  "description": "Portfolio refers to any combination of financial assets held by a trader. In the world of vectorbt, \"portfolio\" is a multidimensional structure capable of simulating and tracking multiple independent but also dependent portfolio instances. The main function of a portfolio is to apply a trading logic on a set of inputs to simulate a realistic trading environment, also referred to as \"simulation\". The outputs of such a simulation are orders and other information that can be used by the user in assessing the portfolio's performance, also referred to as \"reconstruction\" or \"post-analysis\". Both phases are isolated in nature, which enables various interesting use cases for quantitative analysis and data science.",
